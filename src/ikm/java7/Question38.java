* Superclass method declares exception, subclass overriden method can declare the same, sub-exception or no exception in
* its signature
*
* If Superclass method does NOT declare an exception, then subclass overriden method CAN declare an unchecked exception
* but not a checked exception in the signature
*
*
* the only rule is that it cannot throw a checked exception that is outside the range of allowable exceptions for the
* parent method
*
* Checked Exceptions : Java throws error at compile time, the user should recover from this. Ex. IOException.
* Unchecked Exceptions : These are runtime exceptions, Java compiler does not ask user to handle these. Example : ArithematicException
