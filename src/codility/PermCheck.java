 * A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given.

 A permutation is a sequence containing each element from 1 to N once, and only once.

 For example, array A such that:
 A[0] = 4
 A[1] = 1
 A[2] = 3
 A[3] = 2

 is a permutation, but array A such that:
 A[0] = 4
 A[1] = 1
 A[2] = 3

 is not a permutation, because value 2 is missing.

 The goal is to check whether array A is a permutation.

 Write a function:

 class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }

 that, given a zero-indexed array A, returns 1 if array A is a permutation and 0 if it is not.

 For example, given array A such that:
 A[0] = 4
 A[1] = 1
 A[2] = 3
 A[3] = 2

 the function should return 1.

 Given array A such that:
 A[0] = 4
 A[1] = 1
 A[2] = 3

 the function should return 0.

 Assume that:

 N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
 each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].

 Complexity:

 expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
 expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
